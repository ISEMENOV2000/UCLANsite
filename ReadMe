## Header and Footer
- Every page has a simple Header and Footer. The Header consists of a Logo and Links of the Home, Products,
- SignUp, SignIn and LogOut. Using Session Storage if the user is not logged in the Cart Page and the LogOut Page
- are unavailable to the user. While if he is logged in then the SignIn and SignUp pages become unavailable.

- The Footer consists of simple links and descriptors.

## Home Page

- The home page has a bit of simple text at the beginning. Then the offers show up. They are dynamic, meaning
- the information is taken from the server and then displayed on the webpage. The page will display as
- many offers as there are rows in the database.

## Products Page

- The products page connects to the database and using a while loop displays all products from the server on
- the webpage. A search bar was added that shows the products that match with a part of their title to the search 
- request. If the user clicks on any product image, he will be redirected to the item page.

## Search Page

- Not displayed to the user. Checks if the user clicked the search button. and if so, retrieves the values
- from the server and creates a new SQL query string that searches the tbl_products table for products whose
- product_title column contains the query value. If no search query has been submitted, the code selects all products
- from the tbl_products table. Next, the code iterates over the rows of the result set using a while loop and generates
- HTML code for each product.

## Item Page

- The item page Uses the Products database to keep track of what item was selected and then display
- the relevant information. It also uses session storage to check if the user is logged in, in order to leave
- a review, if not logged in then the review button will not appear. When the review button is pressed a popup
- appears on the screen where the review should be written and submitted. After submission the page updates
- the database with the new review, the rating and the name of the user that was collected through session storage.
- All the previous reviews are accessed for every item displayed on the item page.

## Submit Page

## SignUp Page

- The signup page displays a SignUp form where the user is required to input a username, an email that has the @ symbol,
- and a password. After the button is pressed the information is stored on the database so that the login page
- can compare the values for a signup.

## SignIn Page

- THe sign in page displays a form where the user has to input their Username and password. Then the page compares them
- to values, in the database. If there is no match then a message appears informing the user of a wrong username or
